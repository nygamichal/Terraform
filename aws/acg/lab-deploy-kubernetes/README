You are an admin who supports one of the largest online comicbook retailers in the world. You are one of a handful of admins who have been assigned to use Terraform to manage the company's cloud deployments. You are being asked to deploy a simple Kubernetes cluster running two NGINX nodes to test out a new web application on a local server before deploying to the cloud. You will need to first set up the cluster using kind and kubectl, and then use Terraform to deploy the NGINX nodes.


---------

1. Create Your Kubernetes Cluster
In the Terminal
Once logged in to your instance, change into the lab-deploy-kubernetes directory.
Use kind and the kind-config.yaml file to create a cluster named lab-terraform-kubernetes.
Point kubectl at your cluster to allow interaction.

Create k8s cluster:
* `kind create cluster --name lab-terraform-kubernetes --config kind-config.yaml`

Get info about k8s
* `kubectl cluster-info --context kind-lab-terraform-kubernetes`

Get info about clusters from kind
* `kind get clusters`

2. Configure Terraform for Use with the Kubernetes Cluster
In the Terminal
Gather cluster information to input values for your variables file.
Edit your terraform.tfvars file and add your cluster host and client certificate values.
Initialize your working directory.


Gather cluster information to input values for your variables file.
* `kubectl config view --minify --flatten --context=kind-lab-terraform-kubernetes`

then just easy terraform init, validate, plan and apply, after that please just use kubectl to verify:)
